      <description>There are certain situations that don&amp;rsquo;t strike me at first. But as time goes on, I&amp;rsquo;ll start to think about it more and more. And that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what happened to me recently.
I was just coming back from school at the time, and anyone who&amp;rsquo;s ever been on a bus now probably has some idea of what it&amp;rsquo;s like to wear protective gear. Simply put, there is a large group of people who either wear the wrong respirator or face shield, or ignore the precaution altogether.</description>

      <description>Today was a tiring day for me. My work is so demanding. Do I need it? Of course, and I even enjoy it. It&amp;rsquo;s always the same thing - railways, bridges and sometimes also rope. The reason for this is probably my lack of creativity. But in other areas it&amp;rsquo;s different.
People are so antediluvian. God gave them consciousness, the greatest capacity for thought, and yet there is someone who enjoys watching these supposedly &amp;ldquo;genius&amp;rdquo; creatures drive themselves to destruction.</description>
