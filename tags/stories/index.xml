      <description>Today was a tiring day for me. My work is so demanding. Do I need it? Of course, and I even enjoy it. It&amp;rsquo;s always the same thing - railways, bridges and sometimes also rope. The reason for this is probably my lack of creativity. But in other areas it&amp;rsquo;s different.
People are so antediluvian. God gave them consciousness, the greatest capacity for thought, and yet there is someone who enjoys watching these supposedly &amp;ldquo;genius&amp;rdquo; creatures drive themselves to destruction.</description>
